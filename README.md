# Oblate spheroidal coordinates
An interactive 2D cut of a 3D oblate spheroidal coordinate system. 
The distance between the foci of the inner spheroid (focal distance) can be modified. The distance can also be continuosly changed, as a movie. The oblate spheroidal coordinate system can be used to represent the gravitational field of a Kerr black hole (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblate_spheroidal_coordinates)
